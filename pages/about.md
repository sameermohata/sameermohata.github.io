# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**,

As a Construction Execution Engineer, I have worked on two projects with Toyo Engineering India Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai, a multinational EPCC, LSTK contractor with a focus on chemical process plant projects. My responsibilities on the first project at VLBP Butyl Phenol Manufacturing Unit at Ratnagiri, Maharashtra included planning and execution of construction activities of Dyke walls, tank foundations, rigid pavements, along with billing and quality control. My role in the current project, HURL Ammonia-Urea Production Unit site, Gorakhpur, UP, involves resource management and construction of the SwitchYard Gear unit and RCC box culverts, which will carry underground power and utility lines from switchyard to all process plants, cooling towers, and substation buildings. At the end of this project, HURL will become the foremost Fertilizer Manufacturing Unit in the Indian subcontinent.I have recognized the importance of a construction scheduling system. Thus, I am currently learning the Python language to develop an economical scheduling system that will streamline day-to-day construction activities.

In my leisure time, I work as a compensated ‘Civil Q&A expert’ on ‘chegg.com’, an American education technology company, that helps me stay updated with all the engineering subjects.These experiences enabled me to learn the best management and technical skills required for advanced leadership positions in the construction industry. In the long run, I hope to apply that experience and knowledge to establish my own enterprise on a global scale.
 At other times you will find me reading books (mostly biographies) or exercising.
